  GE_ENGINE_PROFILER - Must define to use the profilers
  GE_UTILITIES_EXPORT - This must be defined if the geUtilities lib wants to be used as a DLL

Enviromental variables
  %DEVLIBS% - Root folder where the external libraries are located

External Dependencies
  GoogleTest - For Unit Test design
  LZ4 - For data compression
  TetGen - For Delaunay tetrahedralization and Voronoi diagrams
