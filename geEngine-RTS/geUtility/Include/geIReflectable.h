 * @brief   Interface implemented by classes that provide RTTI.
 *
 * Provides an interface for accessing fields of a certain class.
 * Data can be easily accessed by getter and setter methods.
 *
 * Any class implementing this interface must implement the getRTTI() method,
 * as well as a static getRTTIStatic() method, returning the same value as
 * getRTTI(). Object returned by those methods is used for retrieving actual
 * RTTI data about the class.
 *
 * @bug     No known bugs.
