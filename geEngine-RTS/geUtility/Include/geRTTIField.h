   * @brief Types of fields we can serialize:
   *  - Plain: Native data types, POD (Plain old data) structures, or in general types we
   *    don't want to (or can't) inherit from IReflectable. Type must be copyable by memcpy.
   *
   *  - DataBlock: Array of bytes of a certain size. When returning a data block you may
   *    specify if its managed or unmanaged. Managed data blocks have their buffers deleted
   *    after they go out of scope. This is useful if you need to return some temporary data.
   *    On the other hand if the data in the block belongs to your class and isn't temporary,
   *    keep the data unmanaged.
   *
   *  - Reflectable: Field that is of IReflectable type. Cannot be a pointer to IReflectable
   *    and must be actual value type. Type and its fields are serialized recursively.
   *    Supports versioning so you may add/remove fields from the type without breaking
   *    previously serialized data.
   *
   *  - ReflectablePtr: A pointer to IReflectable. Same as "Reflectable" except that data
   *    isn't serialized as a value type, but as a pointer, which may be referenced by
   *    multiple other instances. All references are saved upon serialization and restored
   *    upon deserialization.

       *        should not access any of its data until deserialization is fully complete.

       *        expensive fields that would not contribute to the reference search anyway.
